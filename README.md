## Static_penetration

#Hello everyone! 
This is a DEMO version of a program that can convert files like .AOO or .AO1 to Excel!
As you know, all static penetration results have such an extension and it is very difficult to work with it.

#What the program does:
- Converts the file to excel format, discarding extra headers
- All columns are automatically converted to excel columns!
- The program itself recalculates Pore and Friction by multiplying by 1000
- You choose which columns will be uploaded!

This Demo will end 26.01 :)
